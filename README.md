# Spam and Ham Mail Classification (NLP Project)

In this repo, I have done a project on NLP problem statement, for which we worked on huge dataset.

Developed an NLP project to classify emails as spam or ham using various deep learning models such as GRU, LSTM, RNN, bi-directional LSTM, and machine learning algorithms.
Preprocessed the email data by removing stop words, performing tokenization, and applying text normalization techniques.
Implemented deep learning models using TensorFlow and Keras to capture the sequential nature of text data and achieve better classification performance.
Explored different architectures, hyperparameters, and optimization techniques to improve the model's accuracy and robustness.
Deployed the project as a web application with an intuitive user interface, allowing users to classify emails accurately and efficiently.
